This repo [quickblog](https://github.com/bachmeil/quickblog) replaces the (rather plain) default
theme of quickblog with the cupper theme from Hugo. To use it:

1. Clone this repo in the directory you want to hold your blog.
2. Use quickblog as usual. However, when you copy the files to the server,
    you need to copy the css, images, and js directories. It's a little
    more complicated than the quickblog default.

You need to customize the sidebar menu for this theme. You do that by
editing the array at the top of the menu.js file in the js directory.

I run these scripts locally, so the install script doesn't actually do
anything other than make the scripts executable.
